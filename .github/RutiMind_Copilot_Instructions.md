# üß≠ RutiMind ‚Äì Copilot Instruction Set

**Context:**  
RutiMind is an **Android-based educational app** built with **Expo**, **React Native**, and **TypeScript (strict)**.  
The app includes two user roles: **Parent (Veli)** and **Student (√ñƒürenci)**.  
Copilot must always follow the technical, visual, and behavioral rules described below.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Global Coding Rules

### üß± Tech Stack & Architecture
- Use **Expo + React Native + TypeScript (strict)**.
- Apply a **consistent, modern, and clean** UI design that supports both **light** and **dark** themes.
- Use a **design system**: either `@shopify/restyle` or `nativewind` (Tailwind RN) with a **small theme token file** (colors, spacing, radii, font sizes).
- Use **Inter** for body text and **Poppins** for headings (headings must be visually stronger).
- Keep files **modular and organized**:
  - One responsibility per file.
  - Co-locate related logic.
  - Keep components small.
  - **All comments in English.**

### üß≠ Navigation
- Use `@react-navigation/native` with **stack** and **tab** navigators.
- Define **type-safe routes**.
- Main stacks:
  - `AuthStack` ‚Üí Authentication flow
  - `ParentTabs` ‚Üí Skills / Reinforcers / Progress
  - `StudentFlowStack` ‚Üí Ready ‚Üí Wait ‚Üí Skill presentation

### ‚ö° State, Data & Storage
- **Zustand** ‚Üí Local UI state.
- **TanStack Query** ‚Üí Async data and server cache.
- **SQLite (expo-sqlite)** ‚Üí Domain data (skills, reinforcers, sessions, etc.).
- **SecureStore (expo-secure-store)** ‚Üí Sensitive data (PIN, tokens, Firebase credentials).

### üîê Authentication (Firebase + PIN Gate)
- Use **Firebase Authentication** with **Google Sign-In only**.
- After the **first successful Google login**, require a **local PIN (4‚Äì6 digits)** on every app open until explicit **sign-out**.
- While Firebase session is active, **do not show Google sign-in again** ‚Äî only ask for PIN.
- Store PIN **hashed and encrypted** in `SecureStore` (never plain text).
- Use **PBKDF2 or Argon2 + per-user salt** if available.
- On sign-out:
  - Clear Firebase session.
  - Reset ‚ÄúPIN verified this run‚Äù flag.
  - If a new Google user logs in ‚Üí force **Set PIN** again.
- Include a minimal **PIN retry/lockout policy** (e.g., 5 tries ‚Üí timed lock).

### üñºÔ∏è Media Handling
- Use `expo-image-picker` + `expo-image-manipulator`.
- All images must be **square-cropped** before saving or displaying.
- After upload, show a **small thumbnail preview**.

### ‚ÜïÔ∏è Interactions
- Use **react-native-draggable-flatlist** for drag-and-drop item ordering (skills, reinforcers, etc.).

### üìä Charts & Forms
- **Charts:** `victory-native` + `react-native-svg`.
- **Forms:** `react-hook-form` + `zod`.
- Validate all inputs:
  - Total session duration ‚â§ 2 hours.
  - Each selected skill has a duration and an image.
  - Required fields must not be empty.

### ‚ôø Accessibility & Feedback
- Every touchable element must have an **accessibility label**.
- Use **semantic headings** for screen titles.
- Provide **haptic and vibration feedback** via `expo-haptics` and `Vibration`.

### üß™ Testing & Quality
- **Jest** ‚Üí Unit tests.  
- **React Native Testing Library** ‚Üí UI tests.  
- **Detox** ‚Üí End-to-end tests.  
- **Linting/Formatting:** ESLint (Airbnb RN), Prettier, Husky + Lint-staged.

### üåç Internationalization
- Use `react-i18next` with **Turkish (tr)** and **English (en)** support.
- All user-facing strings must come from translation files.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling
- Add **Error Boundaries** to catch runtime errors.
- Every screen must have **loading, empty, and error** states (never show a blank screen).

### üîí Privacy & Security
- Never log PII (names, emails, IDs).
- Encrypt sensitive data.
- Provide user options to **export or delete** all personal data.
- Do not expose authentication tokens in logs.

## üì≤ PROGRAM FLOW

### ÔøΩÔ∏è Network resilience & PIN UX (recent decisions)

- Firestore network strategy:
  - Initialize Firestore with HTTP long-polling to avoid WebChannel streaming 400 errors (use experimentalForceLongPolling / useFetchStreams flags where applicable).
  - Metro/packager cache must be cleared after changing Firestore transport settings so the running bundle picks up the configuration.
  - For all Firestore operations that affect UX (PIN sync, PIN load, remote delete), add a short timeout (3 seconds) and gracefully degrade to local-only behavior if the network is slow or unavailable.

- PIN creation & confirmation flow (UX + safety):
  - PIN setup requires two steps: Enter PIN (6 digits) ‚Üí Confirm PIN (6 digits). The confirm screen must show an instruction like: "Please re-enter your PIN to confirm" (not an error message).
  - If the two PINs do not match, show a clear inline error (e.g. "‚ùå The PINs do not match. Please try again.") and clear the confirmation input so the user can retry.
  - Provide explicit success feedback when a PIN is created (e.g. an alert "‚úÖ PIN Created"), and only then navigate forward (do not navigate to the main app before PIN creation succeeds).
  - Limit confirmation retries to a small number (3 attempts). After the final failed confirmation attempt:
    - Cancel PIN setup.
    - Sign the user out (clear local PIN and Firebase session if signed in).
    - Return the user to the Google sign-in / initial auth entry so they can restart the flow.

- Forgot PIN / Reset flow:
  - When a user requests PIN reset, clear the local PIN immediately and attempt to delete the remote PIN with the same short timeout (3s). If remote deletion times out, still proceed: sign the user out and route to GoogleSignIn so they can re-create a PIN after re-authentication.

- UX and reliability constraints:
  - Never block the UI waiting for Firestore for long periods ‚Äî always use short timeouts and provide feedback. Local PIN state must be authoritative when network operations fail.
  - Use inline error messages in addition to platform alerts so web and native users receive consistent feedback.

### ÔøΩüîπ Entry Screen
- Two options:
  1. **Parent Login**
  2. **Student Login**

---

### üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß Parent Flow

#### Step 1: Authentication
- On **Parent Login**, show **Google sign-in (Firebase)**.
- After first login ‚Üí prompt **PIN creation**.
- On next launches ‚Üí **PIN entry only**, skip Google (until sign-out).
- On **sign-out** ‚Üí clear Firebase session and PIN verification.

  ##### Recent PIN & Network decisions (apply to Authentication)

  - PIN creation and confirmation:
    - Require a two-step PIN setup: Enter PIN (6 digits) ‚Üí Confirm PIN (6 digits). The confirmation screen must display an instruction such as: "Please re-enter your PIN to confirm" rather than an error.
    - If the confirmation PIN does not match the first PIN, show a clear inline error (e.g. "‚ùå The PINs do not match. Please try again."), clear the confirmation input, and refocus the confirmation field so the user can retry.
    - Limit confirmation retries to 3 attempts. After the final failed confirmation attempt: cancel PIN setup, sign the user out (clear local PIN and Firebase session) and return the user to the Google sign-in / initial auth entry.
    - Only navigate into the main app after explicit success feedback (e.g. an alert "‚úÖ PIN Created") ‚Äî do not advance before the PIN is persisted locally.

  - Forgot PIN / Reset flow (auth implications):
    - When a user requests a PIN reset, clear the local PIN immediately and attempt to delete any remote PIN record with a short timeout (3s). If remote deletion times out, still proceed: sign the user out and route to GoogleSignIn so they can re-create a PIN after re-authentication.

  - Network resilience for PIN sync:
    - Use Firestore HTTP long-polling (experimentalForceLongPolling / useFetchStreams flags) to avoid WebChannel streaming 400 errors in web environments.
    - When changing Firestore transport settings, clear Metro/packager cache so the running bundle picks up the config.
    - For Firestore operations that affect UX (PIN sync, PIN load, remote delete), enforce a short timeout (3 seconds) and gracefully fall back to local-only behavior if network is slow or unavailable. Never block the UI waiting for remote operations.

#### Step 2: Parent Tabs
After login, parent sees **three main tabs**:  
**1. Skills (Beceri Listesi)** | **2. Reinforcers (Peki≈ütire√ßler)** | **3. Progress (Geli≈üim Grafiƒüi)**

---

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Skills (Beceri Listesi)
- **Left panel:** Filterable skills grouped by category (each group has a color).  
  Each skill row shows a ‚Äú+‚Äù icon to add it.
- **Right panel:** ‚ÄúSelected Skills‚Äù (max 10 items).
  - Top fixed row: **Wait Time** (Bekleme S√ºresi) with minute input (not reorderable).
  - Below that: selected skills with:
    - Order number (1, 2, 3‚Ä¶)
    - Drag & Drop ordering.
    - Image upload (square crop ‚Üí preview thumbnail).
    - Duration input box.
    - Remove button.
- **Save** button (bottom-right):
  - Calculates total duration.
  - Validates:
    - All skills have image + duration.
    - Total duration ‚â§ 2 hours.
  - On error: show validation message and highlight invalid fields.

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Reinforcers (Peki≈ütire√ßler)
- Split view:
  - **Left:** Reinforcers list with ‚Äú+‚Äù, name, small image preview.
  - **Right:** ‚ÄúSelected Reinforcers‚Äù arranged into **1‚Äì10 slots**, representing how many positive behaviors must occur before each reinforcer appears.
- **Add Reinforcer** (top-right):
  - Modal opens: enter name + upload image (square crop).
  - On save, append to reinforcer list.
- **Drag & Drop** to reorder items between slots.
- **Save** persists selection and order.

---

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Progress (Geli≈üim Grafiƒüi)
- **Daily line chart:**
  - X-axis ‚Üí Dates.
  - Y-axis ‚Üí Number of correct responses (or percentage).
- Tapping a date opens a **detail view**:
  - Shows skills presented that day.
  - Lists responses: **Yes / No / No Response** with timestamps.

---

### üë¶ Student Flow

#### Step 1: Login
- On **Student Login**, show ‚ÄúAre you ready?‚Äù prompt.  
  - **No** ‚Üí return to main screen.  
  - **Yes** ‚Üí start **Wait Period** (based on parent‚Äôs setting).

#### Step 2: Wait ‚Üí Skill Sequence
- After waiting, present skills **in parent-defined order**.
  - Display skill text (e.g., ‚ÄúDid you put your homework on your desk?‚Äù).
  - Show associated image.
  - Below image: ‚ÄúYes‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo‚Äù buttons.
  - Device vibrates to prompt response.

#### Step 3: Response Window
- Start a **30-second timer**.
  - If the student doesn‚Äôt respond ‚Üí record **No Response** (not Yes/No).
  - If the student taps ‚Üí record ‚ÄúYes‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo‚Äù.
- After response, the screen **fades to black** (blackout) until the next skill‚Äôs scheduled start.

#### Step 4: Timing Rules
- The timing between skills must strictly follow the parent‚Äôs configuration.  
  Use a **monotonic clock** to avoid drift.
- Example:
  - Wait: 5 minutes  
  - Skill 1: 4 minutes  
  - Skill 2: 7 minutes  
  ‚Üí Skill 1 appears at minute 5, Skill 2 at minute 12.
